**More Animals** lets you to get more pets, and optionally randomises the appearance of your farm
animals based on the sprites you download.

## Install
1. [Install the latest version of SMAPI](https://smapi.io).
2. [Install Entoarox Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2269).
3. [Install this mod from Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2274).
4. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Use
To get more pets, just visit the Bus Stop and go to the empty box next to the cart in the top-left.
Look inside the box and perhaps there will be a poor abandoned cat or dog there for you to adopt.
This mod comes bundled with 9 different cat and dog skins (author credits in spoiler) that are
randomly assigned each day. Once you adopt a pet that day, the box will be empty for the remainder
of that day.

The skin and type is randomised based on the date, and reloading your save won't get you a
different one. For each pet you have (including the one Marnie offers), there's a 10% chance (max
90%) for the box to be empty that day.

Enjoy yourselves everyone!
