This version of Entoarox Framework is a almost complete rewrite of the whole framework.

Currently, in 2.0 only the `Entoarox.Framework.UI` namespace remains as-is
Everything else has been overhauled so that a single `using Entoarox.Framework;` will allow you to access the full framework functionality.

The functionality in 2.0 is completely build around extension methods.
This means that rather then adding new classes or API's for you to work with, everything has been hooked into existing classes or derived from existing API's

The following SMAPI classes have extension methods:
- IModHelper
- IContentHelper
- IMonitor

The following SDV classes have extension methods:
- GameLocation

The following API's can be reached through extension methods on IModHelper:
- IConditionHelper
- IMessageHelper
- IPlayerHelper
- IPlayerHelper.IPlayerModifierHelper

The following interfaces and classes are available for use with extensions made available:
- IContentHandler (IContentHelper)
- PlayerModifier (IPlayerModifierHelper)
