This version of Entoarox Framework is a almost complete rewrite of the whole framework.

Only the following namespaces have remained unchanged:
- Entoarox.Framework.UI
- Entoarox.Framework.Extensions

Next to these unchanged namespaces, the following classes are also still in place:
- Entoarox.Framework.OverlayMenu
- Entoarox.Framework.StackableShopObject

A major part of the goal behind the framework overhaul is to lower how many `using` statements a user of the framework needs.
As of 2.0, the amount of namespaces in the public framework are the following:
- Entoarox.Framework
- Entoarox.Framework.UI
- Entoarox.Framework.Events
- Entoarox.Framework.Extensions
There is also the internal `Core` namespace that is only used by internal mechanics.

In the Events namespace, many events have been removed as SMAPI now provides build-in support for these.
